					Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are
					currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United States. While there
					are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and diet can differ between
					breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally recommended for the
					well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.

							It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is
							either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible.
							Monitor your kittenâ€™s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is
							progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate,
							a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle
							or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight
							appropriately include the following:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
							<li>Gastrointestinal disease</li>
							<li>
								Environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary
								conditions

							Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically
							around three to four weeks after birth. According to the
							<a
								href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips"
								target="_blank"
								>ASPCA</a
							>, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or
							six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has
							difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to
							soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the
							additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness.
							Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary
							requirements. You should always consult with your veterinarian for
							recommendations.

							rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk
