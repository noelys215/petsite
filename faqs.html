				<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

				<p>
					Our “Pexperts” typically encounter the following questions when consulting with
					prospective “pet parents:”
				</p>
			</section>

			<!-- Q1 -->
			<section class="card about-us">
				<h2>Question: What is the best way to rid my dog or cat of fleas?</h2>
				<div class="cat-box">
					<img src="images/shockedCat.jpg" alt="Image of a shocked cat" />
					<div>
						<p>
							Sometimes our furry friends pick up hitchhikers that make them very
							itchy and uncomfortable. If gone unchecked, fleas can infest your home,
							making it even more difficult to rid them from your loved one’s coat. To
							eliminate fleas, choose a shampoo specially formulated to kill fleas and
							be sure to read and follow all instructions on the label. Repeat
							treatment as necessary until your pet is free of fleas; if you see skin
							irritation, stop use immediately and contact your local vet.
						</p>

			<!-- Q2 -->
			<section class="card about-us">
				<h2>Question: How long can I expect my pet bird to live?</h2>
				<div class="cat-box">
					<div>
						<p>
							The answer can vary widely depending on the type of bird, the size, the
							environment, and of course, mother nature. Assuming all is well in the
							external factors that are out of the owner's control, cockatiels and
							budgies live up to 20 years old on average. However, many parrot
							variations are known to live nearly an astounding 100 years! As with
							many living organisms, longevity can be increased by keeping annual
							veterinarian visits, maintaining a healthy diet, and keeping your
							feathery friend's environment sanitary.

			<!-- Q3 -->
			<section class="card about-us">
				<h2>Question: How often should I feed my pet snake?</h2>
				<div class="cat-box">
					<img src="images/snake.jpg" alt="Image of Snake" />
					<div>
						<p>
							Most snakes eat one to two times per week, depending on their age, size,
							and activity level. Female snakes often increase their food intake as
							breeding season gets underway. Some snakes can go as long as two weeks
							before needing their next meal; this is normal. However, if your snake
							has not eaten in two or three weeks and seems lethargic, reach out to
							your local vet to determine if your snake might be ill or injured.
